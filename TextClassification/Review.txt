Some parts of this series are done very well. I really enjoyed the barrels scene and Bard's showdown with Smaug. However, some parts are downright comical. When Thorin slinks back from Bard's questions I laugh out loud and shake my head. I also felt like their was not much of a build up to Battle of the Five Armies, at least not a captivating buildup. There were some areas where I felt the writing could have been riskier and some areas probably should have stayed truer to the book. These are fun movies to watch scene by scene, but I think some of the overall interweaving stories weren't quite filled with the promises and satisfying fulfillments I had hoped for. I suppose that is what happens when you try to fit in the same runtime from one 300 page book as you did with three 400 page books.
