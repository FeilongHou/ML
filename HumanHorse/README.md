# AI Identify Human or Horse

This project is done using python and TensorFlow CNN

## Here are examples of traning image:
Human:\
![Human](https://github.com/FeilongHou/ML/blob/main/HumanHorse/human05-13.png)\
Horse:\
![Horse](https://github.com/FeilongHou/ML/blob/main/HumanHorse/horse05-5.png)\
Training Images are 300x300 colored pictures with different angles of objects and variety of background.\
Validation set of the same sized images are used to increase accuracy.\
**All Training Images Are From Google**


## Here are example of real images for AI to identify
Human:\
![Human_test](https://github.com/FeilongHou/ML/blob/main/HumanHorse/person1.png)\
Horse:\
![Horse_test](https://github.com/FeilongHou/ML/blob/main/HumanHorse/horse1.jpg)

This AI is able to achieve 80% accuracy on read images recognation.

**Testing Images Are From The Internet**
